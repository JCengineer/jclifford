Growing up in a guesthouse owned by my folks, surrounded by 
my parents working around the clock to keep their customers happy was a great experience.
It taught me that hard work pays off and that reputation means a lot.
It has also shown me what an integral part technology plays in most businesses these days.
<br><br>
The majority of guests that stayed at the house, when I was a kid, knocked on the door looking for accommodation;
"organic" by way of their feet, not by "clicks".
These days price comparison sites, booking engines and credit card providers rule the industry.
Now it's a game of SEO (Search Engine Optimisation), pay-per-clicks and so on.
We all have to embrace such technology in order to keep the business flowing.
<br><br>
Being self-employed in my previous work as a sound engineer and event technician has
also helped me to learn the do's and don'ts of business, working with clients and how to keep them.
That's tough and usually thankless work, especially in Ireland where the industry is small and everyone knows each other.
If you get hired, it's a miracle.. <!--until you realise that you're dependent on a very unforgiving and 
undependable industry of bars, pubs, clubs and festivals in fields!-->
I enjoy the work I do in this industry though and it's a great way to meet some amazing people.

This entrepreneurial way of life led me to found my own start up company â€“ VisiLit.
Through working on many events and stage productions, I spotted a challenge faced
by production teams to communicate and design the event together, visually, without 
incurring huge venue costs pre-event. At VisiLit, we built the solution.
Jumping from a one man band to a start up buiness with global potential throws you in the deep end of business development.
I enjoyed every bit of it and although we weren't successful in our first attempt (or second for that matter!),
it has left me with a better picture of what makes successful business tick over and what needs prioritising.
